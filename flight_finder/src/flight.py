FLIGHTS_GRAPH is basically a graph representation of all the possible flights,
used by some functions (find_flights) because it makes performing depth-first
search easier. Keys are the source nodes (= origin airports) and values
are lists of outer edges going from that node to other nodes (= to destination
airports).

Let's say there are following flights:
    A -> B,
    A -> C,
    B -> C,
    B -> A,
    C -> B

Then the corresponding FLIGHTS_GRAPH will look like this:
    {
        A: [(B, flight_A_to_B), (C, flight_A_to_C)],
        B: [(C, flight_B_to_C), (A, flight_B_to_A)],
